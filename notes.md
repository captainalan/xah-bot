This document will document the steps I took to make a bot.

If you are cloning this repository for your own use, you will need to
supply your own authentication token. Create a file called `auth.json`
in the root directory and put in contents like,

```javascript
{
    "token": "REPLACE_ME"
}
```

where you replace `REPLACE_ME` of course!

Bots can be added to servers via invite links:

> ...Adding bots requires you to have the Manage Server permission
> set, else you cannot invite them In the Discord applications page
> you can generate a bot invite, with the permissions needed, and
> assuming you have the prerequisite permissions you can then add the
> bot It's simply a matter of clicking the invitation link, scrolling
> down the drop down box and selecting this server...
